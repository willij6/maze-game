Two nested dictionaries keep track of the state of the game.


SETTINGS

Contains information that can't/doesn't change during the course of a
single game, and is needed by the rules to create the initial state of
the game.

settings['cols']*2+1 = number of columns
settings['rows']*2+1 = number of rows
settings['nmon']     = number of monsters
settings['loops']    = number of shortcuts
settings['top']      = fraction of monsters that start at top
settings['mid']      = fraction of monsters that start at middle latitude
settings['guards']   = fraction that start on shortest path to the player
settings['danger_radius'] = how close monsters need to be, to put the player in a panic
settings['fog_radius'] = vision range of the player, roughly

Two settings control the speeds of the monsters and player character
settings['monster_period'] = milliseconds between monster movements
settings['player_period'] = milliseconds between player movements

the settings shouldn't change during the course of the game,
 so 'settings' can be a dict, not a box

TODO: add settings for maze-generation algorithm


GAME STATE

This contains information on the current state of the game.
Also, by abuse of the listeners pattern, this will also be used
to pass certain messages around.

state['win'] = 1 if player won, -1 if player lost, else 0
state['paused'] = True or False depending on whether game is running
state['open'][(i,j)] = True if location (i,j) is open, else False
  should be defined for 0 <= i < number of columns
  	 		0 <= j < number of rows
  todo: think about whether it should be defined north of the maze exit

state['fog'][(i,j)] = True if location (i,j) is obscured, else False
state['danger'] = True if monsters are in range, else False
state['player'] = (i,j) if player is at location (i,j)
state['monsters'][ell] = (i,j) if ellth monster is at (i,j)


EVENTS/MESSAGES:

state['tick'] = anything: indicates that monsters should advance
state['move'] = (dx,dy) : player is trying to move in direction (dx,dy)
state['tilt'] = anything : player is trying to pause or unpause the game
